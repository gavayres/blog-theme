# What is audio?
It is a vibration in a medium. There is a lot more to it of course but we can think of it as this for now. We can also simplify it into a description of sinusoidal plane waves. These waves can then be characterized by the waves _frequency_, _amplitude_, _direction_ and _speed_. Sound that is perceptible to humans has frequencies of about 20Hz to 20,000 Hz. If we are to build a machine which can output sound it will need to be within these ranges.

# How is audio represented?
Well it must be discrete. So we need to turn what is a continuous signal into a discrete set of samples. We can do this by sampling. We also need to decide how many bits we will use to store each sample. We can represent a wider range of numbers the more bits we use, for example if we use 16 bits then that means we can represent $2^{16}$ bits.
